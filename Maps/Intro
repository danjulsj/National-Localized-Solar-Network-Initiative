Here are the maps I used from QGIS that show all roadways in Texas of types 1 - 5 (highways and major roads) for my calculations. 
I assumed that every square meter of solar panel is capable of producing 1.0 - 1.5 kW each day and multiplied that by a rough estimate of areas of majorr roadways in Texas
