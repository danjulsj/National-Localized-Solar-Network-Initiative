# Executive Summary

With increasing demand for renewable energy and an ever-increasing global temperature, solar energy is the future for energy production. However, current developments in solar energy production are inefficient, with approximately 5-10% of all energy produced being lost during transmission and distribution. While this seems like a small percentage, when seen on the scale of 4.24 trillion kiloWattHours in 2022 in only the U.S., that's 424 million kiloWattHours wasted a year. Or, if numbers aren't your thing, that's a lot of energy. Solar farms and really all electric powerplants are placed quite far from the communities they serve. And just so you know, your physics teacher lied to you. Wires and cables are not perfect conductors. Rather than banishing your solar panels in the desert, why not put them on roads? As a Texas resident, I and my fellow Texans refrain from exiting any air-conditioned structure at all times. Even to get boba. Not being able to get boba is a humanitarian crisis. Half-blind from the roads and baked alive just by being outside, we began brainstorming (frying, rather) why we are simply letting thousands of kilowatts of energy simply go to waste? The Sun's energy has to go somewhere and if we are to cope with its open declaration of war on Texans, we should at least put that energy to good use. So, why not take all that sunlight that's frying our eyeballs and turn it into usable electricity? Thus, our idea was baked like a cake.

drastically reducing vehicle weight and thus wasted energy lugging batteries and/or engines around
